		<p>Pulling and twisting paths to their destinations, in a sense of form follows function. The design style focuses on the functionality of the building more than the aesthetics of the building.</p>

		<p>The word “Distorted” means, pulled, twisted out of shape, contorted, or giving a misleading or false account or impression; misrepresented. With Fichardt street, the street is already pulled and twisted out of shape, in a way, neglecting trash everywhere, movement is prohibited and is dominated by cars and businesses. The people walking alongside the street must change their movement to their destination simply because the stores are not big enough and business extends to the edge of the street. There is a sense of connectivity between people and businesses, but the road to the destinations is restraining it.</p>
		<p>The phrase “Form Follows Function” was first used by Louis Sullivan in one of his articles known as “The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered”. Here he used the term form ever follows function which was later shortened to form follows function. Sullivan was inspired by the Art Nouveau architectural style, but his design style focused on the functionality of the building compared to the aesthetics of the building.</p>
		<p>The theory of, “Edge”,” Border” and “Boundary” are dynamic and invisible lines, which hold the potential for both interactions and divisions in city life, contributes to the theory of Louis Sullivan. In a sense of a metaphorical way, because the form of the building is going to lead the people to their destinations and the function of the bridge is going to act as invisible lines to their destinations, and react as a connection between buildings and functions, with the street and people. With a safe and calm feeling in mind.</p>
		<p>In the process of distorted destinations, there is a neglect of green spaces. With the process of designing a pocket or pause, the building is going to have pockets of green spaces and look-out points to the market side and Fichardt street. The building is going to be elevated to keep the aspect of existing structures/buildings. But also create a moment of hierarchy in the design.</p>
